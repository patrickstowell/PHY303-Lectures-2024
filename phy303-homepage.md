# Course Info.

The Nuclear Physics course will provide an introduction to the field of nuclear physics. Nuclei are the building blocks of 
everything we experience.

We will study their basic properties and review some of the applications of nuclear physics. 
The course is organised in 6 units in blocks of one or two weeks each:
- Unit 1: Introduction, units and liquid drop model
- Unit 2: The shell model and nuclear properties
- Unit 3: Nuclear decays
- Unit 4: Nuclear reactions
- Unit 5: Nuclear physics applications. Energy and medicine

### Course Organisation
The course consists of 5 units, each corresponding to about two weeks of learning. 
There will be two lectures per week with the relevant materal released each week following the timetable above.
The final week (week 12) will be dedicated to a revision of the material. 

### Background knowledge
Essential concepts will be reviewed, however some background knowledge is assumed from your previous physics studies. In 
particular:

- Second year subatomic physics (PHY21004 or PHY251)
- Third year particle physics (PHY304)
- Atomic physics (PHY332)

### Reading list
We will be referring to two main textbooks:
- Martin. Nuclear and particle physics. Available online
- Krane. Nuclear Physics. Full book is available in the library. We will use its chapter 5, which is available online

The textbooks and additional reading material is available in the "Resource List" on the left of the blackboard page.
Additional material, such as worked solutions and other examples will be released during the semester in the form of notes and 
videos. 


### Assessment
The module is assessed by two components, homeworks and the end-of-semester examination. Two homeworks will be marked and returned, 
with comments.  The total homework mark counts 15% towards the module. 
The full timetable of the assessments is available in the Assessment tab
