# Course Info.

The Nuclear Physics course will provide an introduction to the field of nuclear physics. Nuclei are the building blocks of 
everything we experience.

We will study their the theory behind their structure and properties and review some of the applications of nuclear physics. 
The course is organised in to 11 units with a rough aim to cover one unit each week
- Unit  1 : Introduction
- Unit  2 : Liquid Drop Model & SEMF
- Unit  3 : The Shell Model
- Unit  4 : Properties of Nuclei
- Unit  5 : Excited States and Gamma Decay
- Unit  6 : Alpha and Beta Decay
- Unit  7 : Nuclear Reactions
- Unit  8 : Compound Reactions
- Unit  9 : Neutron Physics
- Unit 10 : Nuclear Medicine 
- Unit 11 : Nuclear Power

Note that some of the more complex units later in the course (e.g. reactions) may be taught over multiple weeks.

## Course Organisation
The course consists of 5 units, each corresponding to about two weeks of learning. 
There will be two lectures per week with the relevant materal released each week following the timetable above.
The final week (week 12) will be dedicated to a revision of the material. 

## Background knowledge
Essential concepts will be reviewed, however some background knowledge is assumed from your previous physics studies. In 
particular:

- Second year subatomic physics (PHY21004 or PHY251)
- Third year particle physics (PHY304)
- Atomic physics (PHY332)

## Reading list
We will be referring to two main textbooks:
- Martin. Nuclear and particle physics. Available online
- Krane. Nuclear Physics. Full book is available in the library. We will use its chapter 5, which is available online

The textbooks and additional reading material is available in the "Resource List" on the left of the blackboard page.
Additional material, such as worked solutions and other examples will be released during the semester in the form of notes and 
videos. 


## Assessment
The module is assessed by two components, homeworks and the end-of-semester examination. Two homeworks will be marked and returned, with comments.  The total homework mark counts 15% towards the module. 

The full timetable of the assessments is available in the Assessment tab on blackboard.


# Feedback

Comments, suggestions, or required clarifications on the course lectures or these notes are always welcome.

The general module feedback form can be found on the blackboard page [here](https://blackboardlink).

There is a also form to raise questions on the jupyter notes specifically [here](https://googleforms).
