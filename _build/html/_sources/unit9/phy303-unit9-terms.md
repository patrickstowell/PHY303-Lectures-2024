## Unit 9 : Equations & Terms

The neutron physics unit contains no new equations or constants, calculations are based primarily on reaction physics and $Q$ value calculations from previous units. You should however make sure you are familiar with the following definitions below in the context of neutron physics.

- Neutron decay lifetime
- Ultracold neutrons, cold neutrons, thermal neutrons, epithermal neutrons, fast neutrons 
- Different types of radioactive neutron sources
- AmBe neutron sources
- Spontaneous neutron sources
- Photoneutron sources
- Spallation neutron sources and their stages
- Neutron generators
- Reactor neutron energies and operation
- Moderation, and requirements for a good moderator
- Neutron detection principles
- How gas proportional counters work and fill gasses.
- How neutron scintillators work
- How solid state neutron detectors work
- Principles of neutron activation analysis
