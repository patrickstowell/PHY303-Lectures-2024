# Unit 4 : Additional Problems

For those looking for additional problems outside of past exam questions and the worked problems in the lectures please consider the following in the reading list.


- What is the shell model of the nucleus, and how does it help determine the ground-state properties of nuclei?
- How does the Pauli exclusion principle affect the arrangement of nucleons in nuclear shells?
- What are magic numbers, and why are they significant in determining nuclear stability and structure?
- How would you assign the spin of a nucleus for which the highest energy shell is one nucleon away from being full?
- Give two reasons why the shell model energy levels for protons are slightly different than for neutrons.
- What are the expected ground state spins and parities for the following nuclei Li-7, P-31, I-127?

- How do you determine the total angular momentum (spin) of a nucleus using the shell model?
- Why does the spin of a nucleus with an even number of protons and neutrons usually equal zero?
- For an odd-A nucleus, how does the unpaired nucleon dictate the nuclear spin?
- How can the magnetic moment of a nucleus be estimated using the shell model and the properties of the unpaired nucleon?
- Explain the contribution of the g-factor to the calculation of a nucleus's magnetic moment.
- How does the Schmidt model approximate the magnetic moments of nuclei, and what are its limitations?
- What physical properties of the nucleus influence its electric quadrupole moment?
- How does a non-spherical charge distribution in a nucleus give rise to a measurable quadrupole moment?
- Why do nuclei with spin $ I = 0 $ or $ I = \frac{1}{2} $ have no electric quadrupole moment?
- For a nucleus with $ Z = 21 $ and $ N = 21 $, identify the valence nucleons and predict the ground-state spin and parity.
- How does the spin-parity ($ J^\pi $) of the nuclear ground state depend on the orbital angular momentum of the valence nucleon?
- Using the shell model, how would you predict the magnetic moment and quadrupole moment of $ ^{17}O $, assuming it has a single valence neutron in the $ 1d_{5/2} $ shell?
