#### Example 4.1 : Carbon Mass Calculation
Given the mass of a carbon-12 atom is $12u$, estimate the binding energy of the carbon nucleus.
```{admonition} Solution
:class: note, dropdown

First we start with the mass of the proton, neutron, and electrons in the atomic mass units. Since the mass if that of a carbon-12 atom, we include the electrons in our 
calculation.
