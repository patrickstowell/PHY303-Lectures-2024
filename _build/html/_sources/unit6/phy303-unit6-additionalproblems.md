# Unit 6 : Additional Problems

For those looking for additional problems outside of past exam questions and the worked problems in the lectures please consider the following.


- Write the equations for neutron and proton fusion to form deuterium and for deuterium photo-dissociation.
- Look up the doublet method for measuring the deuterium binding energy with a mass spectrometer.
- In alpha decay, what are the approximations made in the derivation we did for the Po-212 Half Life.
- Explain the general features of the cloud chamber plot and the beta energy spectrum plot shown and why they indicate the need for a third decay.
- N-22 has mass 20487.686 MeV and can decay  by (a) EC to Ne-22. What is the Q value (energy released in each case)?
- Other than PET what other types of nuclear medicine are there.
- Briefly explain the meaning of all the terms in the Fermi equation for Beta decay.
Explain what the basic conditions are for spontaneous decay of a nucleus to occur.
- Describe and sketch the Geiger-Nuttall relation in alpha decay, write out the relevant equation relating the half-life to the energy released Q.
- Describe the factors involved in the solution for the transmission probability of an alpha escaping from a nucleus.
- Explain the development of our understanding of the nucleon-nucleon potential.
- Write out the types of pion exchange that can occur in nucleon-nucleon scattering.
- Estimate the pion masses using the uncertainty principle.
- Explain at least 4 factors that contribute to the nuclear force potential between nucleons.
