# Unit 3 : Additional Problems

For those looking for additional problems outside of past exam questions and the worked problems in the lectures please consider the following in the reading list.

- Explain how the quantum number $j$ comes about.
- Write out and explain the notation for the energy levels of nuclei in the basic shell model.
- How manynucleons (protons and neutrons) can fill the I=2 and 3 levels.
- Explain parity and how it is assigned to nucleons and nuclei.
- Explain spin-orbit coupling and how this may deepen or weak the depth of the potential well.
- Explain the plot of nuclear stability shown and list the half-lives of all A=121 isotopes from Xe to Ag (look these up).
- Use the fit to the stability curve to find the most stable isotope with A=121.
- What are mirror nuclei? What is the mirror nucleus of N-16?
- Explain the evidence for the shell model that comes from observation of interactions between neutrons and nuclei?
- Give a simple reason why Cd might have a high cross-section for neutron absorption.
- What can you say about fission in relation to neutrons and the shell?
- What is meant by reduced electric quadrupole moment?
- The U decay series ends with Pb-206 and the Th decay series in Pb-208. Both these isotopes are of course stable, but which is more abundant and why?
- What effect does asssuming the Saxon-Woods potential have ont he energy levels compared with assuming a harmonic oscillator?
- Explain the nucleon level filling in a nucleus as based on the Saxon-Woods dervied nuclear potential prior to application of spin-orbit coupling.
- How is the 1f level filled when spin-orbit coupling is applid?
