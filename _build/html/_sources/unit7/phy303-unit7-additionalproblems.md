# Unit 7 : Additional Problems

For those looking for additional problems outside of past exam questions and the worked problems in the lectures please consider the following in the reading list.



## Unworked Example : p-p Chain 

Write out the the three reactions that make up the pp chain in the Sun in nuclear physics notation:

1. $ p + p \to d + e^+ + \nu_e $
2. $ d + p \to ^{3}He + \gamma $
3. $ ^{3}He + ^{3}He \to ^{4}He + 2p $


## Unworked Example : Alpha Reactions

**If an $ (\alpha,n) $ reaction takes place on the following nuclei, what is the final nucleus in each case?**

1. $ ^{7}Li $
2. $ ^{12}C $
3. $ ^{63}Cu $


## Unworked Example : Particle Physics Notation

**Write out the following reactions in particle physics notation:**

1. $ ^{63}Cu(\alpha,2n)^{65}Ga $
2. $ ^{53}Cr(\alpha,p)^{56}Mn $
3. $ ^{34}S(\gamma,p)^{33}P $



## Unworked Example : Additional Q-Values 

**Calculate the Q-values for:**

1. $ ^{63}Cu(p,n)^{63}Zn $
2. $ ^{59}Co(d,2n+d)^{57}Co $
3. $ ^{19}F(\alpha,n)^{22}Na $

**Calculate the Q-values for:**

1. $ ^{22}Na(n,p)^{22}Ne $
2. $ ^{23}Na(n,p)^{23}Ne $
3. $ ^{12}C(n,\gamma)^{13}C $
4. $ ^{13}C(n,2n)^{12}C $

**If you took samples of these isotopes ($ ^{22}Na, ^{23}Na, ^{12}C, ^{13}C $) and irradiated them with thermal neutrons ($ \sim 0.025 \, \text{eV} $), which reactions would take place?**
