# Unit 2 : Additional Problems

For those looking for additional problems outside of past exam questions and the worked problems in the lectures please consider the following in the reading list.


- Try using the SEMF equation to plot out the charge density vs radius for a U-238 nucleus using an excel spreadsheet.
- Explain the terms in the Rutherford scattering formula.
- Describe why the asymettry term has the form it does and why the pairing term has the form it does.
- Go through the isotopes from C-12 upwards to F-16 and compare the pairing term energies.
- Why does the pairing term in the SEMF ressult in a higher B/A for nuclei with both N and Z even.
- List at least six properties of nuclei that the SEMF fails to explain.
- Write out the mass deficit equation accounting for the atomic electrons as well as the nucleons.
- Consider the alpha particle decay Th-230 -> Ra-226 + $\alpha$. Use the expression for the binding energy to calculate the value of B for the two heacy nuclei involved in and hence find the kinetic energy of the alpha particle given that the alpha binding energy is 28.3 MeV.
