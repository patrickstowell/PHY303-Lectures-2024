1. Explain how a Geiger counter works.
2. Explain how much gamma radiation you emit due to K-40.
3. In the decay chain of 238-U down to 206-Pb how many alpha particles are emitted.
4. Write out yourself the sequance of alpha and beta decay for the U decay chain going down to Radon (Rn-222) - i.e. starting with U-238, Th-234, ...
5. Define the units Becquerel, Gray, Sievert. What is the Q factor for alphas.
6. In nuclear physics define: Z. A. N. isobars, isotopes, isotones.
7. What is the typical binding energy per nucleon in nuclei (in MeV/nucleon)?
8. At what A does the maximum in binding energy occur? What is the origin of the local peaks seen in the binding energy curve?
9. Write out equations for mass deficit and binding energy of nuclei (remember to get the sign correct, i.e. do you gain or lose energy when a heavy nucleus is pulled apart?).
10. Calcualte the mass defect and the binding energy per nucleon of 62-28Ni.
11. Derive an expression for the attenuation of a beam of particles through a thin film of material.
12. Explain the approxiamtions made (at least three) in the dereivation of Rutherford scattering formula.
13. Why is the Mott Scattering Equation better than the Rutherford Formula? Why did the Mott formula still disagree with electron scattering data of Hofstadter?
14. What is the formula for mass deficit?
15. Sketch the Saxono Woods form of charge and mass distribution in nculei and explain the terms in the equations given in the lecture.
16. Try using the equation to plot out the charge density vs radius for a typical nucleus, say 238U, using an excel spreadsheet.
17. Explain the terms in the Rutherford Scattering Formula.
18. Describe why the assymetry term has the form it does and why the pairing term has the form it does?
19. Go through the isotopes from 12C upwards to 16F and comapre the pairing term energies.
20. Why does the pairing term in the SEMF result in a higher B/A for nuclei with N and Z even.
21. List at least siz properties of nuclei that the SEMF fails to explain.
22. Write out the mass deficit equation accounting for the atomic electronds as well as the nucleons.
23. Consider the alpha particle decay Th-230 to Ra-226+alpha. Use the expression for the binding energy to calcuylate thee value of B for the two heavy nuclei involved in and hence find the kinetic energy of the alpha particle given that the alpha binding energy is 28.3MeV.
