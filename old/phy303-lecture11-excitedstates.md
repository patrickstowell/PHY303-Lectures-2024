The shell model predicts excitations when protons or neutrons move up to a higher energy level

Example 130Sn
50 protons (magic number)
80 neutron (magic number -2)
Lower excitation corresponding to neutron across the latest occupied shell

Moving one neutron from 3s1/2 to 1h11/2 leaves two neutrons unpaired
Combine J=1/2 with J=11/2 we get states with 11/2+1/2 and 11/2-1/2
Similarly a neutron can be promoted from the 2d3/2 level
With states 11/2+3/2 to 11/2-3/2

Another alternative is to break a pair of two neutrons in the 1h11/2 shell

All these create energy level around the 2 MeV line

A state at 1.2 MeV is observed
2+ state

Orbital momentum 
                  =
Final state spin

States with large L are disfavoured


Some states are 
not allowed because 
of parity conservation


### 11.2 Gamma Decay

OOf the three decays we discussed in 

**Filled shells have a total angular momentum, J, equal to zero. The next added nucleon (a valence nucleon) determines the J of the new ground state. When nucleons (singly or in pairs) are excited out of the ground state they change the angular momentum of the nucleus as well as its parity and isospin projection quantum numbers. The shell model describes how much energy is required to move nucleons from one orbit to another and how the quantum numbers change. Figure 6-2 shows an energy diagram of the two filled shells of the ground state of 12C. Promotion of a nucleon or a pair of nucleons to an unfilled shell puts the nucleus into one of the excited states shown in Fig. 6-1.**
