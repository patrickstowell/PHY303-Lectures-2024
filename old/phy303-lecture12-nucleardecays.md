```{tab-item} Question 1
A nucleus has the following sequence of states beginning with the ground state, $\frac{3}{2}^{+}, \frac{7}{2}^{+}, \frac{5}{2}^{+}, \frac{1}{2}^{-},$ and $\frac{3}{2}^{-}$. Draw a level scheme showing the intense $\gamma$ transistions likely to be emitted and indicate their multipole assignment. (Krane 375-8).

```{tab-item} Question 1
An even-Z, even-N nucleus has the following sequence of levels above its $0^+$ ground state: $2^+ (89 keV)$, $4^+ (288 KeV)$, $6^+ (585 keV)$, $0^+ (1050 keV)$, $2^+ (1129 KeV)$. (a) Draw ane enrgy level diagram and show all reasonably probably $\gamma$ transistions and their dominant multipole assignments. (b) By considering also internal conversion, what additional transitions and multipoles appear?
