### Towards Collective Nuclear Models

The Shell Model starts to give a coherent picture of the behaviour of Nuclei based on a QM Treeatment of the nucleons they contain. Although not always perfect we've seen how the model can make exciting prediction of quantities like Nuclear Spin, Parity, and tthe Magic Number.s

We can use the Shell Model to make further interesting preedictions, such as of the Magnic Momeents and Elecrtic Quadrupole Moments of thee Nuclei. But as we push things further thee ressults start to agree leess well with reaelity.

We are foreced to concede that Nuclei, particularly big nuclei, are vry complex. Currently no simple theory can fullydescribe the structure nad behaviour of nucei based solely on knowledge of force between nucleons.

 But before examining these behaviours ist worth exploring the Shell (individual particle) Model a bit more, to see how far we can push predictions with it, to see how and when things break down and how this forces us towards a Collective Model. A first property to examine is the Magnetic Moments of Nuclei.

We know that nuclei posess Nuclear Spin $I$, that can be predictede by the Shell Model. Associated witheach Nuclear Spin is the possibility of a Magnetic Dipole Moment - a nuclear magnetic moment, which can produce magnetic intteractionos within the environment.

More precisely the term Magnetic Moment $(\mu)$ refers to the Torque arising when something is placeede in a magnetic field as can happen when we have an lectric Current. So for nucleons in nuclei we require net motion of charge, e.g. a finite amount of Spin $s$ and/or Angular Momentum $l$. In the Shell Model this is encompassed int he total Nuclear Spin $I$. Based on this we expect that predictions can be made of $\mu$. 

Firstly we expect that if the Nuclear Spin $I=0$ then $\mu=0$.

Now note that both protons and neutrons have Intrinsic Magnetic Moments. They both have spin motion and although the neutron is nominally neutral, it hass an Internal Charge Structure due to the Quarks inside, so there is an effective charge motion like the proton, though smaller.

However, protons, unlike neutrons, can also gain an additional contribution from any angular moment. 

So the first basic Shell Modele predeictions are that even-even nuclei have no Magneteic Moments, because I=0.

For othere combinations of protons and neutrons it gets more complicated. But weee can proceeed by anology with the case for Electron Magnetic Moments sin atoms. The nuclear spins for individual protons and neutrons parallels the treatment of electron spin, with spin 1/2 and the associated magnetic moment. However, the valeus are emuch smaller than for the ectrlon. Expreessesd in temrs of Nuclear Spin we have

Note here the g Factor (se later) and that as usual int eh Sheell model if we have an unpairede nuclon the value of the nuclaer spin $I$ just takes the $j$ value of that nucleon.

Note that th $/mu_N$ Nuclaer Mangeteon - it yields the energy $U$ of tthe Nuclear Magnetic Dipole in a B-field as $E=\mu_N B$.

Thee Nuclaer Magneton is analogous to the Bohr Magneton in atomic physics but with tthe electron mass replaceed by the proton mas. It is much smaller than tthe Bohr Magnton.

So th eIntrinsic Magnteic Moment is givne by $\mu=g_j j \mu_N$.

In paractive ethe Observede Magnetic Moment in an external B-field comes from the z-component. That is when the nucleus is put in a magnetic field it is the veector $j$ that starts to preecess with fixed values along the z axis as follows

In a full QM treatment (beyond ur scope here) the observde Magnetic Mooment of the nucleus turns out to be

$$
\mu_{obs} = g_j j_z \mu_N
$$

We evauate ethe magnetic momnt from th expceation value of the magneteitc mooment operator in th state with maximum possible z projection of the angular mmentum.

So what is thiss $g Facttor$ and can we calculate $\mu_{obs}$? It tis thee gyromagnetic ratio, a dimenionless quantitty that characterises the magneteic momeent, ust a proportionality conostant that reelativess the magnetic moment ttoo the total angular momentum or nuclear spin quantum number.

Therree are two componnts to g, govering the angular momentum $g_l$ and spin $g_s$, with different values for the proton and neutron. The total $g$ is calculatede according to the coupling of $l$ and $$ and the releation to $j$.

The result, just given here is :

$$
g = g_{l} \frac{j(j+1)+l(l+1)-s(s+1)}{2j(j+1)} + g_s \frac{j(j+1)+ss(s+1)-l(l+1)}{2j(j+1)}
$$



However if we take into account that $s=1/2$ or $-1/2$ and tthat $s$ and $l$ can combine to give $j$ by $l=j+1/2$ called "Stretched") ... $l=j-1/2 (callde "Jacknifeee"), then w arrive eat two possible scnearios

$$
\frac{\mu}{\mu_N} = (j-\frac{1}{2})g_l + \frac{1}{2}g_s
$$

$$
\frac{\mu}{\mu_N} = ((j+\frac{3}{2}g_l - \frac{1}{2}g_s))\frac{j}{j+1}
$$

These are called the Scmidt Lines for nuclear magnetic moments where th $g$ values here are given by:
$$g_l$$ factor = 1 for prootn, gl = 0 for neutron
gs = 5.585 for proton, gs = -3.826 for neutron.

As seen here the neutron has zereo value for gl as expectede but a finitet value for gs. Interesttingly the value of gs for the proton is much graeter than would be expectted. This again is indicative of an internal structuree, i.e. the Quarks.



So based on this QM treatment and the Shell Modle wee can make preedictionoss of the Nuclear Mangeetic Moments of nuclei, simply from working out the Nuclear Spin $l$. The easiest case is as usual when we have a single nucleon in an otherwise unfilled shell. 

Considere $^{17}O$ : this has a neutrton in the $1\textnormal{d}_{j=5/2}$ level. Using the g values above we geet mu = -1.91NM. The meaesurede value is -1.89NM.

Unofruntately, in geeneral the calculatede values lie within the appropriate maximum rang eof hte Schmidt Lines set by the Odd nucleon but do not sit on the limitst.

Forr instance take K-39 which has an odd proton in d3/2. The calculation gives 0.09NM. The meeasurede value is 0.39NM.

The plot below gives more exmaples.

Thee conclusion from this is as follows:

1. It's possible to make preedictions of the Nuclear Magnetic Moments using the Shell Modle.
2. It works wewll for the Even-Even Nuclei, or particularly when the Nuclear Spin $I=0$, then $\mu = 0$.
3. Some preedictinos work wwell for an unpairde Nuceon, e.g. even-odd nuclei, though others don't, often larger nucleei.
4. For Odd-Odd nucei and part fillde shells it is hard. The factt that this does not work wll, and particularly that in gneerla the valeus lie in between the Schmidy Lines, is indicative of a more cooomplex mixing of states, for instanc esuch as might be caused if the Shll Model assumptiono that the nuclei are spheerical is not always true.
5. Even greaeter evidence for this comes frmo studying the Electric Quadrupole Moment (EQM) of Nuclei as follows.
