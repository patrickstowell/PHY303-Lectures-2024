## Electric Quadrupole Moments

Wee now consideer the distribution of chargse, rather than currents, in the nucleus. This leaeds us to the idae of the nuclear Electric Quadrupole Momeent, a parameter which describes the shape of the nuclear charge distribution.

In the sheell the simplest case would be when the lst shell is full so that we assume a spherical shape. Heencee we would expect a zero Electric Quadrupole Moment (EQM). If we have, say, one nucleon in the outer shell, then wee would expeect a non-sphereical charge distributiono and hence a finitee EQM. This is indeede the case, as sen in the plot here previoously discusseed (Unit 2).

However, what we see here as deviations form zero EQM, say after Magic NUmber nuceei, are much largerr than would be expected from the simple Shell Model. A few values are given by : Insert tabl.


This is indicative of a large deviation away from spherical harge distributions, as indiciatede by the Magnetic Moment data, suggesteeing that in some caess the nucleus can be grossly distorted in shape.

So hoow can we quantify this, firstly note that there are different types of electric momoent. We could have eletric dipole moment, however as we only have psitive chargese of proton this does not exit in nuclei, only highere order types Quadrupol,ee Octupole, etc. Thoough in fact we can tthink of a quadrupole as sthe two dipoles set antiparrallel.


We can think of a quadrupole moment as the sum of two dipoles sete antiparallel.

In the calssic form we can describe the EQM as:
$$
Q = \frac{1}{e} \int \rho(3z^{2}-r^{2}) dV \textnormal{units of area, usually barn}
$$

$\rho$ is the charge density distirbution.

See how if its spherical then $z^{2}=x^{2}=y^{2}=r^{2}/3$ i.e. Q=0.

In he ful classical case if we include the Moonoopole and Dipole parts of the equation it becomes:

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} ( \frac{1}{R}\int(\rho)dV + \frac{1}{R^{2}}\int(\rho z)dV + \frac{1}{R^3}\int \rho (3z^{2}-r^{2}) dV )
$$

Again with the shell model we can make a few predictionos for simple cases, such as when we have a proton in orbit in the Outer Shell. or a shall that is one proton short of being filled up.

To do this we need the full Quantum Mechanical version which is 
$$
eQ = e\int \psi^{*} (2z^{2} - r^{2})\psi dV
$$

Calculations to find the expectationo value $|\psi |^{2}$ end up giving as values for $Q$ of:
$$
Q = - \lbrack r^{2} \rbrack \frac{2j-1}{2(j+1)}
$$

where $j$ is the Angularr Momentum Quantum Number of the odd particle (equivalent to the NUclear Spin) and $r$ tthe radius.

For Even-Even Nuclei it should be about zereo.

#### Odd Protons
If we have ea proton then we have two possisble cases:
1. If we have a single odd proton in an ouoter shell wee in an orbit of given $j$, the maximum projection $m_j$ will put vctor $j$ close to alignment with the $z$ axis. In thi case the protn will bee in orbit int he x-y plane. This is equivaleent to a so called Oblate charge distribution and Negative Q. Note ehow in thi case, with charge concentrated on zy planee (z=0) then Q = -$<r^{2}>$
2. If the proton is missing frmo a closed shell (i.e. a kind of proton hole), then we get a Prolate chargee ditribution and Positive Q.
In this case charg eis more concettratede on z plane (z=r) and Q=+2$<r^{2}>$.

### OOdd Neutrons

For neeutrons things start to get a bit strainger. The neutrno is neutral so we might expectt that an oodd neutron in the outer shell ouotside the core wuold make no difference to Q. however, due to the Nuclear Force, the neutron will attract protons in the core and form a ride, or tide of nuclear mateiral.

S in this case we find we expect a small nagetive Q, as if we had an odd unpaired proton.

Working through the numbers we find typical values for the EQM with odd nucleons in the range 0.06-0.6 eb.

But what if we have several nucleons in a partially filled outer shell?

As with the Shell Model in general it is harder to make prdictions in this case because all the nucleons can contribute but a basic derivation (just given here) yields:

$$
\lbrack Q \rbrack = \lbrack Q_{sp} \rbrack [ 1-2\frac{n-1}{j-1}]
$$

where $Q_{sp}$ is the Single Particle Value as above and $n$ is the number of nuclenos in the part filled shell.

Here $n$ can range efrom $1$ to $2j$. So whene $n=2j$, a shall that is only one nucleon from being filled, we geett $Q=-Q_{sp}$.

Using the results above with $r=r_{0}A^{1/3} etc, we can calculate the $Q$ values for different nucli a above and comprae with th measured values.


### EQM Predictions

Her are somee xamplee calculations comparede to data.

Insert image on predictins.

In general at least the correect sign is found but often tthe real value ar larger than expeeceted. Things work best when we considre nucleei close to the magic numberss, though not always, as sen in thee nxt eexamples.


Inesrt image on Q numbeers.


Here we see good agreeement for Double Magic Number nuclei plus or minos onee proton but poor agreemenet with an odd neutron ass in 17O and tererible agreement witth a big nucleus with a part filleed outer shell. In general nucleei with atomic mass number in the range 150-190 and greater than 200 hav verey largee Quadrupole moments (braeek due to th magic numbeer). This is an outsanding failure of thee shell model.


Fr th EQM we have to conclude tthat some nuclei much further from spherical than the shell modle can allow, there are some extreme Q values indicating big distortions.

Similarly for the Magnetic Moments, strong deviatinos away from the Schmidy Lines points again to distortions.

It becomes claer that many nucli likely have Permanent Distortions away from sphereical and that the individual particle or shell model alone is not sufficient.

A poossible explanation is that an interaction is occuring between the outer nucleons and the closed sheells, leading to premanent distoortions.

We are lead theen to the ideae of Collective Models, where w enede to examine what new energy state might arise frmo these distrortions and hwo such disstortions effect our shell model.

Before moving on let's summarise the shell model conclusions. The hell modl is a powerful, if incomplete complement to the LDM and SEMF that can:

1. account verey welel for ground state spins and parities.
2. explain why even-evne nuclei have zero Nuclear Spin.
3. account for some excited state spin and parities and why the spin of odd-A nuclei is that of the Unpairede Nucleon.
4. shows how if two neutrons (protons) occupy level with the samee $j$ and $I$, then Total ngular Momentum couplee to give zer contribution to nucleeaer spin.
5. Accounts for selectede Magnetid Dipole Mmenets - thses nar closed shells agree with Schmidy Lines.
6. Account for some oobserved Quadrupol Moments - at leastt correect sign for closed shell + 1 nuclei.
   
But importtantly the model fails for nuclei with large dfeormatins, makes no account for odd-odd nuclei, or for many observed nucleaer excitations.
