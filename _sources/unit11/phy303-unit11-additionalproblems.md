# Unit 11 : Additional Problems

For those looking for additional problems outside of past exam questions and the worked problems in the lectures please consider the following in the reading list.

### Quick Problems

1. Fill in the blanks in these fission reactions and calculate their Q-values:
- $ ^{235}U + n \to ^{90}Kr + ^{144}Ba + ? $;
- $ ^{239}Pu + \gamma \to ^{92}Sr + ? + 3n $;
- $ ^{252}Cf \to ^{106}Nb + ? + 4n $.

2. $ ^{252}Cf $ has a half-life of $ 2.64 \, \text{years} $ and a branching ratio for spontaneous fission of $ 3.09\% $. On average, each fission produces $ 3.76 \, \text{neutrons} $. How many neutrons per second are emitted by $ 1 \, \text{mg} $ of $ ^{252}Cf $?

3. The distribution of the actual number of neutrons emitted per fission is remarkably Gaussian (see Krane, figure 13.7) with a standard deviation of $ 1.08 $. If the mean number of neutrons produced in the fission of $ ^{235}U $ is $ 2.42 $, what is the probability that a fission of $ ^{235}U $ will produce no neutrons?

4. Which of the following heavy nuclei would you expect to have large thermal neutron cross sections? Justify your answers:
- $ ^{251}Cf $;
- $ ^{253}Es $;
- $ ^{255}Fm $;
- $ ^{250}Bk $.



## Unworked Example : Proton-Boron Fusion Reaction

The reaction $ p + ^{11}B \to 3\alpha $ is sometimes considered for commercial fusion. Its advantages include all charged products and $ ^{11}B $ being stable and abundant (80% of natural boron). 

1. What is the $ Q $-value of this reaction?
2. What is the Gamow energy for this reaction?
3. Compare the Gamow energy for this reaction with that of d-t fusion.
4. Explain, as quantitatively as possible, why this reaction is unlikely to be used in commercial fusion reactors in the foreseeable future.

Relevant atomic mass:
- $ ^{11}B $: 11.0093052 u

Relevant particle masses:
- Proton ($ p $): 1.0072765 u
- Neutron ($ n $): 1.0086649 u
- Deuterium ($ d $): 2.0135532 u
- Tritium ($ t $): 3.0155007 u
- Alpha particle ($ \alpha $): 4.0015062 u.
