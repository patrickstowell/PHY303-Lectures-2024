# Unit 1 : Additional Problems

For those looking for additional problems outside of past exam questions and the worked problems in the lectures please consider working through the following nuclear physics probems. Some problems will require some additional research online, and some provide some early exposure of topics discussed in detail later in the course.


- Explain how a Geiger counter works.
- Estimate how much gamma radiation your body emits due to K-40.
- Explain the use of Tc-99 in nuclear medicine. Why is a gamma energy of around 100 keV quite a good energy for use in imagine of the body?
- In the decay chain of a single U-238, down to Pb-208 how many alpha particles are emitted?
- Write out for yourself the sequence of alpha and beta decays for the U decay chain going down to radon (Rn-222): i.e. starting at U-238, Th-234, etc.
- In nuclear physics define: Z, A, N, isobars, isotopes, isotones?
- What is the typical binding energy per nucleon in nuclei (in MeV/nucleon)?
- At what $A$ does the maximum in binding energy occur? What is the origin of the local peaks seen in binding energy curves?
- Write out equations for mass deficit and binding energy of nuclei (remember to get the sign correct, i.e. do you gain or lose energy when a nucleus is pulled apart?)
- Calculate the mass deficit and the binding energy per nucleon of 62-Ni by looking up its total mass online.
- Derive an expression for the attenuation of a beam of particles through a thin film of material.
- Explain the approximations made (at least three) in the derivation of the Rutherford scattering formula (look it up if necessary).
- Why is the Mott scattering equation better, and why did this still disagree with the electron scattering data of Hofstadter?
- What is the formula for the mass deficit?
- Sketch the Saxon-Woods form of charge and mass distribution in nuclei and explain the terms in the equations given in the lectures.
