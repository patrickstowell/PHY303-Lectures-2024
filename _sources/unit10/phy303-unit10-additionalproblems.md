# Unit 10 : Additional Problems

For those looking for additional problems outside of past exam questions and the worked problems in the lectures please consider the following in the reading list.


## Unworked Problem : Cardiac Collimation
Calculate the efficiency and resolution for the "Cardiac High Resolution" collimator ($ d = 2.03 \, \text{mm} $, $ t = 0.15 \, \text{mm} $, $ l = 48 \, \text{mm} $).

## Unworked Problem : Collimator Shielding
For $ ^{99m}Tc $ gamma rays in soft tissue ($ a = 0.15 \, \text{cm}^{-1} $), what fraction of $ \gamma $-rays will be observed for a tumor at $ x = 4 \, \text{cm} $ and a collimator half-angle of $ 0.18 \, \text{radians} $? Assume efficiency $ \eta = 2.1 \times 10^{-4} $.

## Unworked Problem : Collimated Gamma Count Rates
Cardiac perfusion imaging typically uses $ 550-1100 \, \text{MBq} $ of $ ^{99m}Tc $. What is the count rate observed with the "Cardiac High Resolution" collimator? State any assumptions.



## Unworked Example: Brachytherapy for Lung Cancer

A clinical trial found that $ ^{125}I $ brachytherapy was more effective than conventional radiotherapy for treating inoperable lung cancer. $ ^{125}I $ decays by electron capture with a half-life of 59.4 days, emitting a 35.5 keV X-ray. 

Given that:
- Mean tumor volume = 312.7 cm³
- Mean radiation dose = 141.6 Gy
- Mean density of the human body = 985 g/cm³

Determine:
1. The average mass of $ ^{125}I $ implanted.
2. The activity of $ ^{125}I $ at the time of implantation.

State any assumptions made in the calculations.




## Problems

1. **Calculate the Q-value for the reaction $ ^{14}N(p, \alpha)^{11}C $ used to produce the PET isotope $ ^{11}C $. Consulting the JANIS database, we see that the threshold for this reaction is approximately 4 MeV proton kinetic energy. Is this what you would expect? Briefly justify your answer.**

2. **Calculate the Q-value for the reaction $ ^{88}Sr(n, \gamma)^{89}Sr $ used to produce the therapeutic isotope $ ^{89}Sr $. Is it possible to produce this isotope using thermal neutron capture? If so, what is the expected photon energy?**

3. **The recommended dose of $ ^{131}I $ for treatment of hyperthyroidism is 550 MBq. If this is administered in the form of Na$ ^{131}I $, what mass of Na$ ^{131}I $ should the patient be given?**
   - *The half-life of $ ^{131}I $ is 8.0 days. The mean atomic mass of sodium is 23.0 u.*
